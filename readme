* About me and this app
I made this application to help my brother to catch his town RiverFerry, called "BAC" in France.
The town is called "La Bouille", it is a small village in France. If you ever go to Normandy. Have a look, you won't regret ;)

* Features :
- search next riverferry
- set a default station
- use own schedules.tsv departure times

* Help me
You can :
- send your personnal schedules.tsv file and location. So I will ship it with the app. (Maybe I'll do a selector)
- report bugs on Github
- fix bugs
- ask features
- add features

* Files
- the apps creates files in the "$SDCARD/riverferry" directory
- "schedules.tsv" is the default schedules sources
- "schedules.tsv.bin" is created using the "schedules.tsv" file

** "schedules.tsv" departure times file format:  
- 1st line is the column header
- column are separated with a tabulation
- next lines are departures
- 1st column is the station
- 2nd column is the station's bank : LEFT or RIGHT value
- 3th column is the days list (comma separated values, no spaces) : "1,2,3,4,5" for monday to friday and "6,7,8" for saturday, sunday and holydays
- next columns are the departure times formatted "hh:mm" : "14:40" or "06:30"

** "schedules.tsv.bin" binary file
This files contains the schedules saved in a binary format to make it quicker to load
if deleted, it is regenerated using the "schedules.tsv" file
